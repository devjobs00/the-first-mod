## 🌾 What does it do?

Farming in Minecraft can be tedious. You harvest your crops, and then you have to manually replant each one. It's boring and takes forever!

**Farmer's Rake** solves this problem! This simple tool lets you harvest AND replant crops at the same time. Just one click, and you're done! Spend less time planting and more time enjoying your farm.

## 🛠️ How to use?

Using the Farmer's Rake is super easy:

1. **Hold the Rake** in your hand.
2. **Have seeds in your inventory** (wheat seeds, carrots, potatoes, beetroot seeds, etc.).
3. **Right-click on a fully grown crop**.
4. **Done!** The rake harvests the crop and automatically replants it for you.

No more tedious replanting. Just click and move on to the next crop!
